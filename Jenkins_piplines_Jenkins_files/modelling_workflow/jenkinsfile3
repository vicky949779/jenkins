// ### Role of agent any in Parallel Stages ###
// 1. Assigns an Available Agent → agent any tells Jenkins to pick any available worker (agent) to run that stage.

// 2. Parallel Execution → Since the stages are inside parallel {}, each stage can run at the same time on different agents (if multiple agents are available).

// 3. Independent Execution → Each stage gets its own environment and workspace, meaning they run separately.

// 4. If Only One Agent is Available → The stages will wait for execution one after another instead of running in parallel.

// ~ Key Point:
//      If you want all stages to share the same agent, define agent any at the pipeline level instead of inside each stage.
